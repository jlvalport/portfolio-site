This is a responsive full screen landing page website.

## How to set up the slideshow

The slideshow changes images by changing the image number from the list of images in this folder:
`img/cover-images/image<#>.jpg`

* Adding more images

1. Rename the images to this format:
`image#.jpg`

Setting the `#` to the successor of the highest
image number in the folder.

2. Inside the Javascript file:
`js/script.js`

Change the variable `numberOfImages` to the
new highest image number in the folder.
